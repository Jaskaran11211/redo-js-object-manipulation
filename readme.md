# JS Object Manipulation – CSC317  
### Assignment: sculptureListLengths Object

This project processes the sculpture data from `data.js` and generates a new object called `sculptureListLengths`.  
Each sculpture is indexed (0, 1, 2, ...) and each property (`name`, `artist`, etc.) is replaced with the length of its string value.

---

## ✔ sculptureListLengths Output (REQUIRED BY ASSIGNMENT)

Run the script:

```
node sculptureScript.js
```

Then paste the FULL output below **inside the JSON block**.

⚠️ Do NOT shorten it.  
⚠️ Do NOT convert it into an array.  
⚠️ This must match EXACTLY what your script prints.

```json
PUT YOUR OUTPUT HERE
```

## ✔ Files Included

- `sculptureScript.js` — The Node.js solution
- `data.js` — Provided dataset
- `readme.md` — Includes assignment explanation + output (as required)

## ✔ How to Run

```
node sculptureScript.js
```

## ✔ What the script does

- Imports `sculptureList` from `data.js`
- Creates an object `sculptureListLengths`
- Each key is a sculpture index (`"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"`, etc.)
- Each value is an object with the lengths of each field's string
- Logs the complete object to the console
- This matches the assignment instructions exactly.
